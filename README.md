### Challenge 4: Ansible Roles & Dynamic Configuration - Reusability & Scale

**Objective:** Refactor your automation into reusable Ansible roles and leverage dynamic variables for flexible deployments.

**What You'll Build (Ansible Focused!):**

- Convert all previous playbooks into **reusable roles** (e.g., `fastify_env`, `nginx`, `database`, `app_deploy`).
- Define **`defaults/main.yml`** for default role variables.
- Utilize **`vars/main.yml`** and **`group_vars`/`host_vars`** for environment-specific or server-specific configurations.
- Advanced **Jinja2 templating** for all configuration files (Nginx, process manager environment, database connection strings).
- Implement **role dependencies** in `meta/main.yml`.
- Introduce **`ansible.builtin.assert`** for basic playbook testing/validation.

**Skills Learned (Ansible Deep Dive):**

- Mastering **Ansible role structure** and organization.
- Comprehensive **variable management** and precedence.
- Advanced **Jinja2 templating techniques** (loops, conditionals, filters).
- Building **reusable and modular automation code**.

- A "wrapper" playbook or script to easily target specific environments.
- Implement `ansible-lint` checks with stricter rules for production environments.
